**Cast Status Indicator** is a helpful addon for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Classic, designed to enhance your casting awareness by providing a visual indicator that follows your cursor and displays your casting readiness.

When the global cooldown (GCD) is active, the indicator switches to a "not-able-to-cast" image. Once your character is ready to cast, it changes to an "able-to-cast" image. This feedback allows you to see at a glance whether you can cast without having to look away from your character or cursor, making it especially useful in PvP or high-intensity PvE scenarios.

#### Features

*   **Cursor-Following Indicator**: The indicator image tracks your cursor, keeping your casting readiness information where you need it most.
*   **Cooldown Awareness**: Quickly see if your character is under GCD or ready to cast.
*   **Customizable Images**: By default, the addon uses two images (`able-to-cast.tga` and `not-able-to-cast.tga`) included in the addon folder. Feel free to replace them with custom images of your choice.

#### Installation Instructions

1.  Download the **CastStatus\_Indicator** folder and place it in your WoW **Interface/AddOns** directory.
2.  Confirm that `able-to-cast.tga` and `not-able-to-cast.tga` are inside the **CastStatus\_Indicator** folder.
3.  Start or restart WoW, then enable **Cast Status Indicator** from the AddOns menu.

#### Troubleshooting

*   **Addon Not Visible in AddOns List**: Make sure the `CastStatus_Indicator` folder is in the `Interface/AddOns` directory and the `.toc` file is named correctly as `CastStatus_Indicator.toc`.
*   **Custom Images Not Displaying**: Ensure your replacement images are in `.tga` format and follow the naming convention (`able-to-cast.tga` and `not-able-to-cast.tga`).
